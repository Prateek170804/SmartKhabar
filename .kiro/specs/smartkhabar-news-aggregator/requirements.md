# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SmartKhabar is a personalized AI news companion that goes beyond traditional news aggregators by understanding user preferences and delivering intelligent, bite-sized summaries. The system uses FAISS for semantic search and retrieval, Langchain for LLM orchestration, and various news APIs to create a tailored news experience that adapts to each user's interests, preferred tone, and reading time constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a news reader, I want the system to automatically collect fresh news articles from multiple sources, so that I have access to comprehensive and up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs its collection process THEN it SHALL retrieve articles from at least 3 different news sources (CNN, BBC, TechCrunch, Hacker News)
2. WHEN an article is collected THEN the system SHALL extract headline, body text, timestamp, source, and category tags
3. WHEN new articles are available THEN the system SHALL update the content database within 30 minutes
4. IF a news source is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue collecting from other sources without interruption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want articles to be processed into searchable, semantic chunks, so that the system can find the most relevant content for my interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article is processed THEN the system SHALL clean and chunk the text into digestible paragraphs
2. WHEN text chunks are created THEN the system SHALL generate semantic embeddings using Langchain-compatible models
3. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in FAISS database with metadata (source, category, date, chunk_id)
4. WHEN articles exceed 1000 words THEN the system SHALL split them into multiple chunks while preserving context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set my news preferences including topics, tone, and reading time, so that I receive personalized content that matches my interests and schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access preference settings THEN the system SHALL allow me to select preferred topics from predefined categories
2. WHEN I set preferences THEN the system SHALL allow me to choose tone options (formal, casual, fun)
3. WHEN I configure reading time THEN the system SHALL accept values between 1-15 minutes for summary length
4. WHEN I save preferences THEN the system SHALL store them persistently in the user database
5. IF I don't set preferences THEN the system SHALL use default settings (general news, neutral tone, 5-minute reading time)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to find articles that match my interests using semantic search, so that I see relevant content instead of generic headlines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request personalized news THEN the system SHALL convert my preferences into embedding queries
2. WHEN searching for relevant content THEN the system SHALL use FAISS to find semantically similar articles
3. WHEN retrieving results THEN the system SHALL return the top 10 most relevant article chunks per user session
4. WHEN no highly relevant content is found THEN the system SHALL fall back to popular articles from preferred categories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive AI-generated summaries that match my preferred tone and reading time, so that I can quickly consume news in a format that works for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL use Langchain to orchestrate the summarization process
2. WHEN creating summaries THEN the system SHALL adapt the tone to match user preferences (formal, casual, fun)
3. WHEN summarizing content THEN the system SHALL respect the user's specified reading time constraints
4. WHEN multiple articles cover the same topic THEN the system SHALL create consolidated summaries to avoid redundancy
5. IF summarization fails THEN the system SHALL provide the original article excerpt with a fallback message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean, responsive interface to view my personalized news feed, so that I can easily browse and interact with content across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the news feed THEN the system SHALL display personalized summaries in a clean, readable format
2. WHEN viewing an article summary THEN the system SHALL show source link, key points, and publication timestamp
3. WHEN I want more information THEN the system SHALL provide "read more" options that link to original articles
4. WHEN I interact with content THEN the system SHALL offer options to hide sources or adjust preferences
5. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and touch-friendly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to learn from my interactions and improve recommendations over time, so that the content becomes increasingly relevant to my interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with articles (read more, hide, like) THEN the system SHALL track these preferences
2. WHEN I consistently ignore certain sources THEN the system SHALL reduce their prominence in future recommendations
3. WHEN I frequently engage with specific topics THEN the system SHALL increase similar content in my feed
4. WHEN my preferences change over time THEN the system SHALL adapt recommendations accordingly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be deployable on Vercel with proper performance and scalability, so that users can access the service reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL be configured for serverless architecture
2. WHEN handling user requests THEN the system SHALL respond within 3 seconds for summary generation
3. WHEN multiple users access simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent users
4. WHEN the database grows THEN the system SHALL maintain search performance through proper indexing
5. IF system errors occur THEN the application SHALL log errors and provide graceful fallback responses
