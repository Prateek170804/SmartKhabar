    "# SmartKhabar - AI-Powered News Aggregation Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's information-saturated world, we're drowning in news from countless sources, struggling to find content that truly matters to us. Traditional news aggregators simply collect headlines, but they don't understand our preferences, reading habits, or time constraints. We envisioned **SmartKhabar** (meaning \"Smart News\" in Hindi) as an intelligent news companion that doesn't just aggregate content—it learns, adapts, and personalizes the entire news consumption experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration came from observing how people consume news differently: some prefer quick 2-minute summaries during commutes, others want in-depth analysis in formal tone, while some enjoy casual, conversational updates. We realized that AI could bridge this gap by creating truly personalized news experiences that adapt to individual preferences and learning patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What it does\n",
