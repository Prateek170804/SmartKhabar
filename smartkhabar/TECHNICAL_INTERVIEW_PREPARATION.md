- Redis-like caching layer
- CDN optimization for static assets
- Lazy loading and pagination
- Database query optimization
- Production monitoring and logging

## Technical Deep Dive Questions

### Database Design
```sql
-- Key tables structure
CREATE TABLE articles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  url TEXT UNIQUE,
  category VARCHAR(50),
  published_at TIMESTAMP,
  embedding VECTOR(384)
);

CREATE TABLE user_interactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  article_id INTEGER,
  interaction_type VARCHAR(20),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Design Patterns
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
