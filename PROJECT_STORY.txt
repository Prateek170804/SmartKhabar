SmartKhabar - AI-Powered News Aggregation Platform

INSPIRATION

In today's information-saturated world, we're drowning in news from countless sources, struggling to find content that truly matters to us. Traditional news aggregators simply collect headlines, but they don't understand our preferences, reading habits, or time constraints. We envisioned SmartKhabar (meaning "Smart News" in Hindi) as an intelligent news companion that doesn't just aggregate content—it learns, adapts, and personalizes the entire news consumption experience.

The inspiration came from observing how people consume news differently: some prefer quick 2-minute summaries during commutes, others want in-depth analysis in formal tone, while some enjoy casual, conversational updates. We realized that AI could bridge this gap by creating truly personalized news experiences that adapt to individual preferences and learning patterns.

WHAT IT DOES

SmartKhabar is a comprehensive AI-powered news aggregation platform that transforms how users consume news through intelligent personalization and summarization. Here's what makes it special:

INTELLIGENT PERSONALIZATION
- Adaptive Learning: The system learns from user interactions (clicks, reading time, preferences) to continuously improve recommendations
- Multi-dimensional Preferences: Users can set preferences for topics, tone (formal/casual/fun), and reading time (1-15 minutes)
- Semantic Understanding: Uses vector embeddings and FAISS-powered semantic search to find truly relevant content beyond keyword matching

AI-POWERED CONTENT PROCESSING
- Smart Summarization: Generates tone-adapted summaries using Hugging Face transformers and LLM orchestration
- Topic Consolidation: Automatically merges similar stories from different sources to avoid redundancy
- Reading Time Estimation: Calculates and adjusts summary length based on user's available time

MULTI-SOURCE AGGREGATION
- Diverse Sources: Collects news from CNN, BBC, TechCrunch, Hacker News, and web scraping
- Real-time Updates: Automated collection every 2 hours with WebSocket-powered live updates
- Quality Filtering: Advanced deduplication and content quality assessment

ENHANCED USER EXPERIENCE
- Responsive Design: Mobile-optimized interface with clean, readable layouts
- Real-time Features: Live breaking news alerts and trending topic detection
- Accessibility: Full accessibility compliance with screen reader support
- Performance: Sub-3-second response times with intelligent caching
